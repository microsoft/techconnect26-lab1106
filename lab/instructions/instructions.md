## Lab Overview

### Introduction

The **Intake Agent** and **Design Agent** are a Microsoft Copilot Studio–built architecture generator that leverages deep-reasoning capabilities (GPT-5 Reasoning model) to transform application intake data into comprehensive Azure architectural designs. This solution enables rapid generation of baseline Azure architectures, significantly accelerating the design phase of cloud migration and modernization engagements.

### What You Will Learn

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- ✅ Import the Intake Agent and Design Agent solutions into your Copilot Studio environment
- ✅ Configure required connections (SharePoint, Email)
- ✅ Upload and configure knowledge base files
- ✅ Generate complete Azure architecture documents from intake data
- ✅ Understand the five standardized architecture views
- ✅ Interpret the Azure Resource Configuration tables

### Key Capabilities

The Design Agent produces:

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Formal Introduction** | Application overview and context |
| **Data Flows** | Main data movement and processing patterns |
| **Architecture Overview** | High-level technical summary |
| **Five Architecture Views** | Logical, High-Level Technical, Detailed Infrastructure, Networking, Observability |
| **Rationales** | Design decisions aligned with WAF and SCF |
| **Resource Configuration Table** | Deployment-ready Azure resource specifications |
